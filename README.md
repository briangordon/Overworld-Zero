Overworld Zero
--------------

You can play a simple game inside a randomly generated world.

* Move around the world; mountains and water are impassable.
* Earn experience by killing monsters. Monsters drop gold coins onto the world when killed. Levelling up increases your HP and attack damage.
* If injured in combat, head to an Inn, where you can restore your HP for a modest price.
* Monsters spawn at randomly-placed camps and amble around protecting their camps.
* When sighted by a monster, it will chase you down and attack you. If you run far enough away from its camp, the monster will lose interest and return to its camp.
* Monsters move in a realistic fashion incorporating randomness so that their movement rules cannot be exploited. For example, it's difficult to snag them on impassible tiles.
* If you can get to a monster camp alive then you will disband it and earn a gold bonus. Another camp will appear elsewhere.
* Object-oriented design allows monsters of different species to chase and attack each other. Monsters can pick up gold to increase their gold value. Monsters can gain experience and level up.
